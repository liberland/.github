# Liberland

The Free Republic of Liberland is a crypto-friendly sovereign state located between Croatia and Serbia on the west bank of the Danube River. Its motto, “To live and let live,” is the foundation upon which we are building a nation that emphasizes personal and economic freedom by limiting government power to its basic minimum.
